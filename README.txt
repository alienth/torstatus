Algorithm to test this code:

If you are Professor Danner, just change 'NAME', 'USER', and 'PASSWORD' in
settings.py to the appropriate values to use the metrics database that we
created, then run "python manage.py runserver [port]".

If you are Karsten, Damian, or anyone else with access to a Tor Metrics
database, make sure you have a postgreSQL backend (psycopg2 or psycopg) 
installed for python. Then, change the fields in settings.py to appropriate
values to test our code with the/a Tor Metrics database. Then run
"python manage.py runserver [port]".

If you are somebody else, we don't have instructions for how to setup such a
database quite yet; check back in a few weeks.
