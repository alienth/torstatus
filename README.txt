If you are somebody else, we don't have instructions for how to setup such a

Design Documentation
--------------------
Design documentation, like this README, is written in reStructuredText.
To generate HTML-formatted design documentation using reStructuredText,
install docutils (available at http://docutils.sourceforge.net/)
and run the following:

    | $ cd doc/
    | $ rst2html design.txt design.html

To view the documentation, open design.html using your favorite web
browser. If you'd rather view the plaintext documentation, open 
design.txt
