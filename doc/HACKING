Some notes on code style:

General:
- Lines do not exceed 72 characters unless things become really ugly.
- No whitespace at the end of any line or file.

Python code:
- Unless something stated in General conflicts, code adheres to PEP 8
  guidelines.
- Unless something stated in General or PEP 8 conflicts, code adheres
  to Django coding standards for developers of the Django platform
  (viewable at: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/
  contributing/writing-code/coding-style/)

SQL code:
- Only cache.sql is currently written in SQL. Having never written
  SQL code before, style is not consistent and probably unconventional.
  Feel free to propose style guidelines.
